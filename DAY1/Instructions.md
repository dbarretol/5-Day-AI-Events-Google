# Day 1 (Introduction to Agents)

Today’s whitepaper introduces Al agents. It presents a taxonomy of agent capabilities, emphasizes the need for an Agent Ops discipline for reliability and governance, and discusses the importance of agent interoperability and security through identity and constrained policies.  
  
In today's codelabs, you'll be building your first AI agent and your first multi-agent system, using Agent Development Kit (ADK), powered by Gemini, and giving it the ability to use Google Search to answer questions with up-to-date information. In the second codelab, the focus will be on multi-agent systems, where you'll learn how to create teams of specialized agents and explore different architectural patterns.
