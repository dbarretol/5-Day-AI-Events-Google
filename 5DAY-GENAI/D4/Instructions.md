# Day 4 (Domain-Specific LLMs)

Welcome to Day 4.  
  
In today’s reading, you’ll delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and MedLM/Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.  
  
In the codelabs, you'll learn how to add real-world data to a model using Google Search and then visualize it with plotting tools via the Live API.You will also learn how to fine-tune a custom Gemini model using your own labeled data to solve custom tasks.
