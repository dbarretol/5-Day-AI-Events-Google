You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",

More than just a culinary ingredient, the olive and its derivatives – primarily olive oil – weave through diverse aspects of our lives, impacting our health, economy, environment, and cultural identities. From the ancient Mediterranean to the globalized world, the olive’s enduring significance lies in its multifaceted contribution to a more sustainable, healthier, and culturally rich existence.\n",

Extensive research has cemented olive oil, particularly extra virgin olive oil, as a key component of the Mediterranean diet, widely recognized for its positive influence on cardiovascular health.  The high concentration of monounsaturated fats, particularly oleic acid, in olive oil helps lower"

He swatted it, of course, with a casual swipe of his paw, but the ladybug simply took flight, flitting towards the slightly ajar window. Curiosity, a trait Jasper usually scoffed at, flickered within him. He’d never been outside. Not truly.\n",
       "\n",

He stalked through the neighbor's meticulously manicured lawn, feeling a thrill he’d never experienced during his carefully curated indoor life.\n",
       "\n",
       "His adventure truly began when he spotted it: a glint of silver flashing in the distance. It was a silver, fish-shaped wind chime, dangling from a weeping willow tree in the park. Jasper, a cat who worshipped at the altar of tuna, felt an irresistible pull.\n",
       "\n",
       "The park was a jungle of legs and wheeled contraptions. He dodged lumbering humans pushing baby-filled carts and darted past children shrieking with laughter. He scaled a towering oak tree, his claws finding purchase in the rough bark. From his vantage point, the wind chime looked even more magnificent.\n",
       "\n",
       "Reaching the willow, he leaped onto a low-hanging branch, the wind chime just inches away. He extended a paw, batting at the shimmering metal. It tinkled merrily, the sound like a siren's song.\n",

       "This file is a **bash script** designed to **enhance your command-line prompt** with information about the current Git repository. It's often referred to as `bash-git-prompt` or similar.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a breakdown:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **What it does:**  When sourced (run) in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file, it customizes your shell prompt to display details like the current branch, the status of your working directory (e.g., staged changes, unstaged changes, untracked files), and information about the remote repository.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Why use it:**\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   **Visual Git Status:**  Immediately see the state of your Git repo without having to run `git status`.  This saves you time and keeps you aware of changes.\n",
       "    *   **Enhanced Workflow:** Makes working with Git repositories easier and more efficient.  At a glance, you know if you have uncommitted changes, if you're ahead or behind the remote, etc.\n",
       "    *   **Customization:**  It allows you to configure the appearance of the Git prompt to match your preferences (colors, symbols, what information is displayed).  It uses themes to control the color scheme.\n",
       "    *   **Virtual Environment Awareness:** It can also display information about the active virtual environment (Python `venv`, `conda`, or Node.js virtual environments).\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **How it works (simplified):**\n",
       "\n",
       "    1.  **Loads Colors and Themes:**  The script loads color definitions and a theme that determines the visual style of the prompt.\n",
       "    2.  **Gets Git Information:**  It uses `git` commands to gather information about the repository (branch name, status, remote tracking, etc.).\n",
       "    3.  **Formats the Prompt:** It assembles this information into a string, incorporating colors and symbols defined in the theme.\n",
       "    4.  **Sets the `PS1` variable:**  It modifies the `PS1` environment variable (which controls the appearance of your shell prompt) to include the formatted Git information.\n",
       "    5.  **Performance Optimization:** It uses asynchronous execution (with `async_run` or `async_run_zsh`) to fetch remote status, preventing the prompt generation from slowing down your shell interaction.\n",
       "\n",
       "In essence, this script is a productivity tool that helps you stay informed about the state of your Git repositories directly from your command-line prompt.\n"
