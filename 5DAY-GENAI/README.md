# 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google

  

Our new 5-Day AI Agents Intensive course with Google is happening right now, November 10th-14th! Registration is now closed, but if you’re interested in learning about Agents, you can still follow along [here](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-agents). This course will be available as a self-paced Learn Guide by the end of November 2025.  
  
5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google - Originally held live from March 31 to April 4, 2025, this program is now available as a self-paced learning guide for anyone interested in exploring the fundamental technologies and techniques behind Generative AI.  

## What's covered:

*   **Day 1: Foundational Models & Prompt Engineering** - Explore the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning, inference acceleration, and reasoning models. Get trained with the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction.

*   **Day 2: Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases** \- Learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases, including embedding methods, vector search algorithms, and real-world applications with LLMs, as well as their tradeoffs.

*   **Day 3: Generative AI Agents** \- Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process, including recent agentspace development.

*   **Day 4: Domain-Specific LLMs** \- Delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

*   **Day 5: MLOps for Generative AI** \- Discover how to adapt MLOps practices for Generative AI and leverage Vertex AI's tools for foundation models and generative AI applications.

*   Capstone Project goes live - See Details in the FAQ
