Here's a look at some of the key themes and recent progress:\n\n**1. Accelerated Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **What's new:** AI algorithms are becoming much better at sifting through massive biological datasets (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, patient data) to pinpoint specific genes, proteins, or pathways that are most likely to be involved in a disease and thus be good drug targets.\n*   **Examples:** AI can identify novel disease drivers that might have been overlooked by traditional research methods. It can also help validate these targets by predicting their relevance and impact.\n\n**2. De Novo Drug Design (Designing Molecules from Scratch):**\n\n*   **What's new:** Instead of screening existing compound libraries, AI is now being used to **design entirely new molecules with desired properties** from scratch. This involves generative AI models that can learn the \"rules\" of molecular chemistry and propose novel structures optimized for efficacy, safety, and manufacturability.\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These are common AI architectures used to create novel molecular structures.\n    *   **Reinforcement Learning:** This is used to guide the design process towards molecules that satisfy multiple criteria simultaneously (e.g., high binding affinity to a target, low toxicity, good solubility).\n    *   **Recent News:** Companies are frequently announcing the discovery of novel drug candidates designed by AI for conditions ranging from infectious diseases to neurodegenerative disorders.\n\n**3. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **What's new:** AI can analyze vast amounts of existing drug data, clinical trial results, and scientific literature to identify drugs approved for one condition that might be effective for another. This is a much faster and less costly path to drug development.\n*   **Examples:** AI has been instrumental in identifying existing drugs that could be repurposed to treat COVID-19, and it continues to be a powerful tool for finding new uses for shelved or existing medications.\n\n**4. Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity:**\n\n*   **What's new:** AI models are becoming increasingly sophisticated at predicting how a potential drug will behave in the human body **before** expensive and time-consuming clinical trials. This includes predicting efficacy against a disease target and potential side effects or toxicity.\n*   **Examples:** This predictive power helps researchers prioritize the most promising drug candidates, reducing the failure rate in later stages of development.\n\n**5. Optimizing Clinical Trial Design:**\n\n*   **What's new:** AI can analyze historical clinical trial data to identify optimal patient populations, predict success rates, and design more efficient trials. This can lead to faster trial completion and reduced costs.\n*   **Examples:** AI can help identify biomarkers that predict a patient's response to a drug, allowing for more targeted and effective clinical trials.\n\n**6. Creating \"Digital Twins\" for Drug Testing:**\n\n*   **What's new:** Some cutting-edge research is exploring the creation of highly detailed computational models (digital twins) of cells, tissues, or even entire organs. AI can then be used to simulate drug interactions with these digital models, offering a more nuanced understanding of drug effects.\n\n**Key Players and Trends:**\n\n*   **AI-First Drug Discovery Companies:** A surge in startups and established biotechs are built around AI platforms for drug discovery (e.g., Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Insitro, Atomwise, Exscientia).\n*   **Big Pharma Partnerships:** Major pharmaceutical companies are increasingly partnering with or acquiring AI-driven drug discovery firms, recognizing the transformative potential.\n*   **Focus on Specific Disease Areas:** While AI can be applied broadly, there's a strong focus on complex diseases like cancer, neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's), and rare genetic diseases where traditional drug discovery has been challenging.\n\n**In summary, the trend is towards AI not just assisting but actively *driving* the drug discovery process, making it faster, more efficient, and more likely to yield novel and effective treatments.**\n\nIf you're interested in a particular aspect of AI in drug discovery (e.g., a specific disease, a type of AI, or a company), feel free to ask!\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned: **De Novo Drug Design (Designing Molecules from Scratch)**. This is a truly revolutionary aspect of AI in drug discovery, moving beyond just analyzing existing data to **creatively generating novel solutions.**\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what it entails:\n\n**The Core Idea:**\n\nTraditionally, drug discovery involved either:\n1.  **Screening:** Testing vast libraries of pre-existing chemical compounds to see if any show activity against a disease target.\n2.  **Lead Optimization:** Modifying existing successful compounds to improve their properties.\n\nDe Novo drug design, powered by AI, flips this by:\n*   **Starting with a blank slate:** The AI doesn't rely on a pre-existing library.\n*   **Defining desired properties:** Researchers tell the AI what they want in a drug molecule (e.g., binds strongly to a specific protein, has low toxicity, is easy to synthesize, can cross the blood-brain barrier).\n*   **Generating novel structures:** The AI then proposes entirely new molecular structures that are predicted to meet these criteria.\n\n**How AI Achieves This:**\n\nSeveral types of AI models are employed, often in combination:\n\n1.  **Generative Models:** These are the workhorses of de novo design.\n    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Imagine two neural networks: a \"generator\" that creates new molecule designs, and a \"discriminator\" that tries to distinguish between real, known molecules and the AI-generated ones. Through this adversarial process, the generator learns to create increasingly realistic and potentially effective molecular structures.\n    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn to compress complex molecular representations into a simpler \"latent space\" and then can decode points from this space back into novel molecular structures. This allows for exploration of a vast chemical space.\n    *   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers:** These models are good at processing sequential data. Molecules can be represented as sequences of characters (like SMILES strings), and these models can learn the rules of molecular grammar to generate valid and novel sequences.\n\n2.  **Reinforcement Learning (RL):**\n    *   Once a generative model proposes a molecule, RL can be used to \"fine-tune\" it. The AI acts like an agent, making \"decisions\" (e.g., adding or removing atoms/bonds) to optimize the molecule based on a reward function that evaluates its predicted properties (efficacy, safety, etc.).\n\n3.  **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):**\n    *   Molecules are naturally represented as graphs (atoms as nodes, bonds as edges). GNNs are excellent at learning from this graph structure, understanding molecular connectivity, and predicting properties more accurately than models that treat molecules as simple strings.\n\n**Key Benefits of De Novo Drug Design:**\n\n*   **Access to Novel Chemical Space:** AI can explore chemical structures that human chemists might not have conceived of, leading to truly innovative drug candidates.\n*   **Speed:** Generating and evaluating potential molecules computationally is far faster than synthesizing and testing them in a lab.\n*   **Optimization:** AI can simultaneously optimize for multiple, sometimes conflicting, properties, which is incredibly challenging for human chemists.\n*   **Reduced Costs:** By identifying promising candidates early and reducing the failure rate, de novo design can significantly lower the overall cost of drug development.\n\n**Recent Milestones and Examples:**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Famously used its AI platform to discover and advance a novel drug candidate for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) into Phase II clinical trials in a remarkably short timeframe. They design molecules from scratch.\n*   **Exscientia:** Has several AI-designed drugs in clinical trials, including candidates for cancer and autoimmune diseases, developed through their generative AI platforms.\n*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning to predict how well small molecules will bind to target proteins, aiding in the design of novel inhibitors.\n*   **AbCellera:** While focused on antibodies, their platform uses AI to rapidly discover and design antibody therapeutics, showcasing the generative power of AI in biologics as well.\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n*   **\"Synthesizability\":** Ensuring the AI-designed molecules can actually be made in a lab is crucial. Models are getting better at incorporating synthetic feasibility.\n*   **\"Synthetizability vs. Novelty\" Trade-off:** Sometimes the most novel molecules are the hardest to synthesize. Balancing these factors is key.\n*   **Data Quality:** The AI models learn from existing chemical data, so the quality and diversity of this data are critical.\n*   **Experimental Validation:** Ultimately, every AI-generated molecule still needs rigorous experimental testing to confirm its efficacy and safety in living organisms.\n\nIn essence, de novo drug design is about teaching AI to be a creative chemist, capable of imagining and constructing molecules that could become life-saving medicines. It's a paradigm shift that's already showing incredible promise.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in **de novo drug design** is rapidly evolving, with a mix of AI-native biotech startups and larger pharmaceutical companies investing heavily in this capability.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
