# Day 5 (Prototype to Production)

Welcome to Day 5 - we’ve reached the last day’s assignment! 🎉  
  
This whitepaper provides a technical guide to the operational lifecycle of AI agents, focusing on deployment, scaling and productionization. It explores the challenges of transitioning agentic systems from prototypes to enterprise-grade solutions, with special attention to Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol.  
  
For today's codelabs, you'll learn how to build systems of multiple, independent agents that can communicate and collaborate using A2A Protocol. You'll also learn how to take your agent from your local machine to a production-ready, scalable service, by deploying your agent to Vertex AI Agent Engine on Google Cloud.
